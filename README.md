##  üìñ About

The simple binary system is a simple realisation java of the binary numerical system. This allows to manipulate of binary digits and bit logical operations.

### 	Motivation

Initially, there was a need to store and manipulate bits, but in Java there is no such type of data. Bits can be stored in different ways and work with them as well. This library helps to unify the process of working with bit operations.

This project was conceived as a simple implementation of a binary calculus system with signed and unsigned data types.

## üì∏ Demo

The demonstration shows binary `AND` operation with 2 bytes.
